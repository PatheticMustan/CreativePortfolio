			<h1>Video Project</h1>
			<p>When I found out Sooah was in Creative Writing, we decided to pair up to create a hurdling tutorial.
				Since we're both on the track team, we would be able to spend a practice session getting footage of him learning
				how to do hurdles. We would also be able to get other real hurdlers to show off what proper form should look like.</p>
			<p>The video goes over an overview of hurdles to stretches, basic lead-leg form, trail-leg form, and
				some demonstrations of what it should look like combined all together.</p>
