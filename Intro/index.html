			<p>They all had the same faceless features: an endless stream of grammar quizzes, book reviews, character analyses...
				Although I went into senior year expecting yet another soulless year-long grind, I was pleasantly surprised by the independent
				nature of creative writing. Unlike previous English classes where we often analyzed the works of long-dead authors,
				this class was almost entirely focused on self-reflection -- an experience that has given me a better understanding of both
				myself and the way I process my thoughts.</p>
			<p>To me, writing has given me a way to preserve my thoughts and identity; it is a collection of my worries, achievements,
				life events, and daily observations. Keeping a journal takes very little effort, but the reward is incomparably large.
				Though it may be easy to remember a song you heard on the radio yesterday, a delicious meal you just had, or a conversation that made you smile,
				these precious moments will be lost in a week's time. Some are perfectly fine with letting the past fade away naturally,
				but remembering these small moments (no matter how insignificant they may seem!) is very important to me.</p>
			<p>Writing also lets me peek into my past -- it is only through comparing my current self to my past self that I can
				see how I've grown. This ability has also given me a greater insight into recurring themes in my life. When I wrote my Common App personal statement,
				I thought that that was the first time I had generated the idea "photography helps me preserve memories".
				While I was browsing my older notes, I discovered I had written the same prompt almost word for word nine months earlier.
				I believed I had come up with something new, but I was merely uncovering a forgotten thought.</p>
			<p>Whether it was through mind-maps, poetry, visual collages, or just flat-out abstract art (Why is Mr. Weinstein not an art teacher?),
				Creative Writing has been all about reflection. Working on the various projects has helped me remember (Ha!) why I enjoyed writing
				in the first place and has given me a new way to express myself. Though it only lasted for half a year, I have a
				feeling I'll remember this class for a long time.</p>
			
			<br><br><br><br><br>

			<p>On a very unrelated note, this class has taught me a very large number of unfortunate but very helpful tidbits about myself!
				I've learned that I am absolutely terrible with deadlines. Dreadful, even. I really wish we had more time with the projects. :(</p>
