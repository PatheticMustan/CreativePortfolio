			<h5>Discuss a piece that demonstrates teamwork. How did a classmate help you to maximize this piece? How did you accept revision suggestions?</h5>
			<p>I think I collaborated with Sooah on the <a href="../VideoProject/#HurdleTutorial">Video Project</a> really well.
				Though we were not able to record footage over break or during days where it rained heavily,
				I think in every other respect our planning was careful and detailed. Here you can see our pre-assignment for the video.
				The final result is pretty close to what we had originally planned, minus the interviewing.</p>

			<p>Sooah's sister (Jinah!) recorded the footage for us. Once we cleaned up the clips, the final video was put together
				by Sooah and transcribed by me. I'm pretty proud of how it came out. 
				In the pre-assignment stage Mr. Weinstein suggested that we "add a woman to the show" in order to 
				show how their hurdle form may differ. To this end, we asked Sarah F to join us for stretching, and other 
				track members with varying levels of experience to join us.</p>
