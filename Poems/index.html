			<h2><a id="OvercomingHurdles" href="#OvercomingHurdles">#</a> Overcoming Hurdles</h2>
			<h6>Contrary to popular belief,<br>
				hurdling is actually a sprinting event<br>
				Though it may be intimidating, jumping is the easy part<br>
				It's the steps in between that make it so scary<br>
				When you feel ready to start, run with heart!<br>
				Raise your leg before the hurdle, keep it unbent<br>
				keep your body relaxed, don't grit your teeth<br>
				and let your body fly</h6>
			<p>I recently did my Visual Project on hurdling, and I wanted to capture a tiny slice of that feeling.
				I started Track in my sophomore year in the middle of the pandemic. Track, being a highly individual sport, was one of the first sports to be brought back as a sort of "trial period" for other sports.
				Though I didn't like long distance running, I fell in love with hurdles when I first tried it. 
				This year, I'm aiming for all-counties in the 55HH and 110HH.</p>

			<h2><a id="ComfyBed" href="#ComfyBed">#</a> "How can I finish my work when I have such a comfy bed?"</h2>
			<h6>I can feel the tug of sleep in the back of my mind, calling out like a loving embrace.<br>
				My bed sings a siren song; tempting me to fall under its covers and leave my work for tomorrow.<br>
				My dearest! My darling! Wrap me in your arms and never let me go.<br>
				If sleeping always felt this good, I would never want to wake up. Dreamy sweet faces lead me to new places<br>
				<br>
				In my dreams I wish I could stay. Like dragons, my worries and fears can be slain<br>
				But I can't run forever, eventually I will wake. <br>
				Waking up every morning is a herculean task; cracking open my eyes to the new day,<br>
				Putting on fresh clothes, splashing cold water, willing my grogginess to just go away<br>
				I wish I could sleep more often</h6>
			<p> I wanted to show just how much I love sleeping. Recently I've felt a little bit more dread during the day. Sleeping provides a safe haven from all the worries of the day. Some sort of escapism!</p>

			<h2><a id="FallingAsleep" href="#FallingAsleep">#</a> "Falling asleep is quite easy, actually"</h2>
			<h6>Recently I've gotten quite good at<br>
				sleeping<br>
				Every time I feel fatigue creeping<br>
				I brush my teeth, pack my things away<br>
				I shower, prepare for the next day<br>
				<br>
				Then I turn off the light,<br>
				No longer blessed with sight<br>
				I try not to think too much about the<br>
				mistakes I've made the day before<br>
				thinking of my fumbles still shakes me to the core<br>
				<br>
				I stumble around the room and hide under covers<br>
				Hold my pillow as if we were lovers<br>
				Laying down in the bed feels cold and lonely<br>
				If only there was another warmth to make it feel homely?</h6>
			<p>For the first poem, I was thinking of writing a poem about having trouble sleeping.  I had fun with enjambment. I did not particularly enjoy rhymes, but I'm quite proud of "lonely" and "homely".
				I was going to write more about slowly drifting to sleep and overthinking late at night, but I felt like it would not have fit with the rest of the poem, so I discarded it.</p>

			<h2><a id="Dreamy" href="#Dreamy">#</a> You're so dreamy!</h2>
			<h6>Lay down in your warm, toasty bed<br>
				or any place fit to lay your head<br>
				Someplace that's kind and soft<br>
				to doze off into a gentle rest<br>
				<br>
				Sometimes dreams can be scary and cold<br>
				Running down endless halls, tripping over your feet<br>
				Other times dreams are joyful, filled with happiness; sweet<br>
				Can you taste the singing? Can you feel the choir?<br>
				<br>
				In my dreams it's as if I'm watching a movie of myself:<br>
				muted colors and noises, without flavors and tactile feeling<br>
				I always watch a stranger who looks like me acting out<br>
				the action movies I wish I could be in</h6>
			<p>Continuing the theme, I tried to make a dreamy feeling by talking about dreams. I think it's really interesting that you have no true way to know how other people experiences things. What seems strange or mysterious to you may be completely normal to others. In my dreams, I often see myself in the third person, acting out what feel like stories or movies. I asked some of my other friends, and to my surprise some of them were able to taste and smell in their dreams!
				Dreams are often said to be generated by your subconscious mind, so analyzing your dreams may provide insights that would typically be inaccessible.</p>
		
			<h2><a id="HeavySleeper" href="#HeavySleeper">#</a> …wish I wasn't such a heavy sleeper</h2>
			<h6>I missed my bus! <br>
				Oh my god, I missed my bus!<br>
				Just getting ready for the day was tough<br>
				Maybe if I wait for long enough, <br>
				I'll see it come 'round the bend<br>
				<br>
				w a i t i n g . . ?<br>
				<br>
				or maybe I just missed it? I sprint the other way<br>
				A glimpse of yellow?<br>
				I heave a relieved sigh, my thighs<br>
				burn! But the bus doesn't notice my running<br>
				and continues with its day<br>
				<br>
				I really…</h6>
			<p>As if it was a continuous story, the poems go from sleeping, dreaming, then missing the bus. I played with the spacing in the word "waiting" to emphasize the pause. I thought it would be silly to have the title act as the closing line.</p>
