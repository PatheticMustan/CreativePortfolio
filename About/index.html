			<p>This portfolio was made with HTML and CSS. None of that "Weebly website builder" stuff.
				It took a lot longer, but made with way more control over the final result.</p>
			<p>I poured my heart and soul into making the entire portfolio a visually pleasing palette! I was hoping to use a
				combination of green that was both easy on the eyes, and comfortable to consume.
				I've learned a few interesting bits about web accessibility, so I thought this project would be a
				great opportunity to use what I've learned.
				<br>
				On a slightly related note, next to each work is a pound sign (<a>#</a>Title) that links to that specific work.
				If you would like to link to a specific section, you can right click on the pound sign and "Copy link address".</p>
			<p>I first learned HTML/CSS at a <a href="https://coderdojo.com/en">CoderDojo</a> event.
				With just a little bit of time, I gained the magical powers of *<i>website design</i>*!
				<br>
				Since then, I've learned other languages like Java, Python, C#, and Javascript. I keep a lot
				of my projects public, so you can see some of my work on my 
				<a href="https://github.com/PatheticMustan">GitHub</a>. Lately I've also been interested in photography and Game 
				Design. Though I post my photos privately, you can see my games on my
				<a href="https://patheticmustan.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page!</p>
