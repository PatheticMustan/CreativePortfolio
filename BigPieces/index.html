			<h4>Immortalizing Memories</h4>
			<p>I stared at the butterfly; its paper-thin wings were completely still. I barely breathed as I edged closer and closer to the winged wonderment. I was five steps, three, two, one step away until I was near enough to touch it. With bated breath, I held my phone above it and willed my trembling hands to be still. Snap! I had taken a picture of a "Question Mark Butterfly" (Polygonia interrogationis).</p>
			<p>The butterfly fell into obscurity along with countless other memories, until it resurfaced a year later buried in my camera roll. Through the fuzzy image, the orange-and-black butterfly stared back at me like a melted jack-o-lantern lost in the wrong season. Small details leapt from the photo. I was transported back to the rough path outside the commuter train station where I first encountered the delicate creature, the oppressive heat of that summer afternoon, and the fatigue I felt from the game design class I had taken that morning in the city.</p>
			<p>I find photography beautiful 一 the way it can capture a moment and immortalize it.  Every instance one experiences will never happen in exactly the same way again; documenting it offers a window into the past. My memories may wither away as I grow older, but the photographs remain forever captured. </p>
			<p>By documenting myself and the things around me, I maintain a time capsule ready to be opened in five, ten, or twenty years in the future. Each vignette offers a unique perspective into the way I saw the world in that moment, and expresses what words alone cannot: the ineffable moments between birthdays, warm smiles, and cold nights. It guards an archive of my growth, both physically and emotionally.</p>
			<p>I try my best to document my life and the world around me – as I experience it. Others describe me as forgetful, underscoring why I strive to chronicle the past. I can barely recall what I ate for breakfast yesterday, much less moments that happened years ago. It terrifies me that I can barely recollect what the younger me thought or felt, and I fear that if I'm unable to reflect on my past, I'll never be able to change as a person. With every day that passes, my past self slips further and further away. </p>
			<p>In an effort to preserve this past self, I used to journal daily, writing about my daily toils or jotting down random thoughts. I started photography in the summer before ninth grade, after my mom bought me my first phone. She had purchased it so I could call her from Manhattan after game design classes, and she but had inadvertently introduced me to a new world to me. </p>
			<p>While the textured plastic-cased phone wasn't the greatest, having a camera ready at all times completely transformed how I perceived my environment; now even the mundane seemed beautiful. Through the camera lens, weeds become biological marvels, alleyways become mysterious passageways to untold secrets, and even common summer pests morph transform into ferocious beasts. I could take in the whole world in its entirety, photo by photo, giving a new perspective to the little things in life. As the summer stretched on, I realized the photos had become my journal. </p>
			<p>Photographs allow me to share my experiences with others. With pictures, I don't need to be eloquent and graceful with my words. In just a glance, other people can see the world through my own eyes. I don't need to verbally describe the exquisite juiciness of my steaming hot dumplings, the soft glow of Christmas lights on the walls, or the glittering lights of the city skyline. One picture tells the story.</p>
			<p>Capturing these small moments has brought me great happiness, but I’ve learned that nothing can replace the joy of experiencing the world myself. Some things aren’t meant to be preserved or seen through a viewfinder; they’re meant to be lived and shared as only that … a memory.</p>
