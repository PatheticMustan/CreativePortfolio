			<h4>Immortalizing Memories</h4>
			<p>I stared at the butterfly; its paper-thin wings were completely still. I barely breathed as I edged closer and closer to the winged wonderment. I was five steps, three, two, one step away until I was near enough to touch it. With bated breath, I held my phone above it and willed my trembling hands to be still. Snap! I had taken a picture of a "Question Mark Butterfly" (Polygonia interrogationis).</p>
			<p>The butterfly fell into obscurity along with countless other memories, until it resurfaced a year later buried in my camera roll. Through the fuzzy image, the orange-and-black butterfly stared back at me like a melted jack-o-lantern lost in the wrong season. Small details leapt from the photo. I was transported back to the rough path outside the commuter train station where I first encountered the delicate creature, the oppressive heat of that summer afternoon, and the fatigue I felt from the game design class I had taken that morning in the city.</p>
			<p>I find photography beautiful 一 the way it can capture a moment and immortalize it.  Every instance one experiences will never happen in exactly the same way again; documenting it offers a window into the past. My memories may wither away as I grow older, but the photographs remain forever captured. </p>
			<p>By documenting myself and the things around me, I maintain a time capsule ready to be opened in five, ten, or twenty years in the future. Each vignette offers a unique perspective into the way I saw the world in that moment, and expresses what words alone cannot: the ineffable moments between birthdays, warm smiles, and cold nights. It guards an archive of my growth, both physically and emotionally.</p>
			<p>I try my best to document my life and the world around me – as I experience it. Others describe me as forgetful, underscoring why I strive to chronicle the past. I can barely recall what I ate for breakfast yesterday, much less moments that happened years ago. It terrifies me that I can barely recollect what the younger me thought or felt, and I fear that if I'm unable to reflect on my past, I'll never be able to change as a person. With every day that passes, my past self slips further and further away. </p>
			<p>In an effort to preserve this past self, I used to journal daily, writing about my daily toils or jotting down random thoughts. I started photography in the summer before ninth grade, after my mom bought me my first phone. She had purchased it so I could call her from Manhattan after game design classes, and she but had inadvertently introduced me to a new world to me. </p>
			<p>While the textured plastic-cased phone wasn't the greatest, having a camera ready at all times completely transformed how I perceived my environment; now even the mundane seemed beautiful. Through the camera lens, weeds become biological marvels, alleyways become mysterious passageways to untold secrets, and even common summer pests morph transform into ferocious beasts. I could take in the whole world in its entirety, photo by photo, giving a new perspective to the little things in life. As the summer stretched on, I realized the photos had become my journal. </p>
			<p>Photographs allow me to share my experiences with others. With pictures, I don't need to be eloquent and graceful with my words. In just a glance, other people can see the world through my own eyes. I don't need to verbally describe the exquisite juiciness of my steaming hot dumplings, the soft glow of Christmas lights on the walls, or the glittering lights of the city skyline. One picture tells the story.</p>
			<p>Capturing these small moments has brought me great happiness, but I've learned that nothing can replace the joy of experiencing the world myself. Some things aren't meant to be preserved or seen through a viewfinder; they're meant to be lived and shared as only that … a memory.</p>

			<h4>Big Fruits Can't Drive Well</h4>
			<p>Sad songs bring me a unique sense of companionship. When I'm feeling bad or a special type of low, music lets me know there is somewhere out there who has felt the exact way I do. While listening to sad music, suddenly I no longer feel quite so alone. As soon as I heard this song, I was completely enamored: its powerful baseline and raw vocals completely captivated my ears. Mega Mango's Artist Biography on Spotify reveals a "playful theme of nostalgic board-game references" with songs like "Boggle", "Sorry!", "Blurt", and "Risk". Though the songs were released separately, they all center around desire: a desire for love, a desire for closure, a desire to feel something other than constant exhaustion.</p>
			<p>The whole song uses driving as an extended metaphor. The song details the narrator's experience with poor mental health, giving an intimate look into depression and isolation. The song begins with the narrator's lament, saying they feel like they've been "driving on the wrong side of the road tonight". The imagery of literally going in the wrong direction clearly demonstrates their feelings of being lost and confused. These negative feelings are further compounded when they says they haven't "seen a single f*cking pair of headlights", highlighting how totally alone they feel. The reckless driving throughout the song serves as a metaphor for the singer's self destructive (and potentially suicidal) behavior, showing how destructive these feelings are.</p>
			<p>The singer then uses the chorus to repeatedly emphasize that despite trying their best, they still feel a persistent exhaustion to the point where "it's hard enough just getting dressed". Throughout the song, the singer seems unsure if their mental health is as bad as it feels, using words such as "feel" and "maybe" or asking if it's "All in my head?" Unlike physical injuries or illness, mental health can only be viewed through introspection. This highlights the common theme of isolation, both for the singer specifically and when dealing with depression in general. One of the common tips for coping with depression is reaching out to others who make you feel safe and supported. Having a network of support is essential to overcoming depression, which is why it's so crushing when the singer feels isolated despite physically being close to others and near home. The idea of isolation is further reinforced through the line "I know I'm not alone or far from home, But I'm freezin'" through the symbolism of being cold. Coldness is defined by a lack of warmth – or in this case, a lack of support from others. When somebody gives the "cold shoulder", they're ignoring a particular person. This line shows the singer's perception that despite their best attempts to reach out, they're being ignored by the ones close to them. Winter coldness often has a negative connotation and represents emptiness and misery, or a lack of (literal or figurative) sunshine.</p>
			<p>The song changes setting in the next verse as the singer returns home. Although the singer is protected by the security of their locked door, they spend the night awake, looking through the window blinds. The singer feels hopeless, afraid that this constant feeling of anxiety will stay with them until their death. This anxiety also leads to difficulty sleeping, as the singer reveals in the line "I've been awake for far too long but there's no end in sight". This idea of hopelessness is reinforced in the repetition of the chorus, where the singer states "But it won't stop until I'm dead." </p>
			<p>The song ends with an explosive outro. In a powerful burst of emotion, the singer cleverly intermingles the phrases "tired of being tired" and "tired of being criticized for what I know is right" into a single line. The song provides a gut-wrenching and relatable anthem for those who feel trapped in the same way. Listeners to the song can learn from its cautionary emphasis on the pain of isolation. By reaching out to others for support, our connections to others make us stronger collectively. Although the song is about sadness, it changed my life for the better and has helped me rediscover the joy of life.</p>
